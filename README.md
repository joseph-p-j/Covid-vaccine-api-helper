# covid-api-helper-india

This is a helper repository for programmers who use php-mysql to access and analyse covid vaccine statistics.
The above files help in populating all district and state values to your mysql database.


How it works?

API is called automatically every 1 second and the response is saved to DB. Advantage is, the host server will not close connection or throw 403 error.
